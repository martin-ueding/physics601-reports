\begin{abstract}
    In this experiment we set up a magneto-optical trap to catch rubidium
    atoms. After that we investigate basic properties of the trap and its
    components.

    We construct a \mot\ with \SI{<< power_mot >>}{\nano\watt} observable
    fluorescence power, \num{<< atom_number >>} atoms trapped and a volume of
    \SI{<< mot_volume_mm3 >>}{\milli\meter\cubed}. The loading time of our trap
    will be determined to be \SI{<< loading_lifetime >>}{\second}. We compute
    the rubidium scattering cross section to be \SI{<< cross_section
    >>}{\meter\squared}.

\chapter{Theory}

\section{Optical cooling}

\subsection{Radiation pressure}

Light, being mediated by massless gauge bosons, has a linear dispersion
relation $E = cp$ with momentum $p = \hbar k$ and wave number $k$. An atom
which absorbs a photon will obtain its energy and also its momentum. While in
stimulated emission the momentum of the emitted photon points in the same
direction as the stimulating atom's momentum, spontaneous emission is isotropic
which leads to a net acceleration. This effect causes the so called radiation pressure.

\subsection{Red detuning}

To cool atoms down one has to make sure that only those atoms that move
towards the laser beam feel this pressure. This can be done using the Doppler
effect: In the rest system of the atom, that flies towards the laser beam, the
photons of the laser are blue detuned, with $\nu'=\nu(1+v/c)$, where $v$ is
the velocity of the atom. To get those atoms on resonance again one has to
detune the laser to the red.

\subsection{Optical molasses}

The force of a laser with intensity $I$ and detuning $\Delta =
\omega_\text{laser}-\omega_\text{res}$ on an atom can be expressed as
\[
    F_\text{radiation} = \frac{\hbar k\Gamma}2\cdot\frac{I/I_\text{S}}{\del{2\frac{\Delta -
    kv}\Gamma}^2 + 1 + I/I_\text{S}}\, ,
\]
where $k$ denotes the wave vector of the photons, $\Gamma$ the decay rate of
the excited state and $I_\text{S}$ the saturation intensity. If we want to cool
the force at $v=0$ should be zero, which is clearly not the case. To solve this
one uses two counterpropagating laser beams with the same detuning. For small
velocities this gives a force depending force:
\[
    F_\text{count} = \frac{8\hbar k^2\Delta}{\Gamma}
    \frac{I/I_\text{S}}{\del{\del{2\Delta/\Gamma}^2 + 1 + I/I_\text{S}}^2}
    \cdot v \underset{\delta<0}{=} -\alpha\cdot v \, .
\]
Applying three orthogonal pairs of lasers gives an effective deceleration of
atoms in every direction and with this a cooling. This setup is known as
\emph{optical molasses}. This cooling process is limited by heating due to
spontaneous emission. This leads to the so called \emph{Doppler limit}
\[
    T_\text{Doppler} = \frac{\hbar \Gamma}{2k_\text{B}} \, .
\]

\section{Magneto-optical trap}

Since the forces in the optical molasses are independent of space, the atoms
 diffuse out of the cooling area. Due to collisions
those atoms get heated up again. We need an additional force that keeps the
atoms inside that area. One possibility is to use a \emph{magneto optical trap}
(\mot).

To simplify the working principle we consider a two level system with one
possible transition ($F=0 \to F=1$). Also we add a 1-dimensional linear
increasing magnetic field without loss of generality along the $z$ axis, which is zero at
$z=0$. Due to the Zeeman effect we get a space-dependent energy splitting of
the three possible $F=1$ configurations, which causes a lowering of the $m=1$
state's energy for $z<0$ and a lowering of the $m=-1$ level for $z>0$ (see
Figure~\ref{fig:mot-principle}).

Now we add two counterpropagating laser beams with detuning $\Delta<0$. If now
the laser beam propagating in positive $z$ direction has a $\sigma^+$ helicity
and the counterpropagating beam has a $\sigma^-$ helicity, atoms which are
located at $z<0$ have a higher possibility to absorb $\sigma^+$ photons and
hence get pushed back to $z=0$. For atoms at $z>0$ it is the other way around.
There the absorption of a $\sigma^-$ photon is more likely, so that they 
also get pushed back to $z=0$.

While in reality the energy levels are way more complex the working principle
remains the same.

\end{figure}

\section{Rubidium}

Natural rubidium consists about \SI{72}{\percent} of ${}^{85}\text{Ru}$ and
\SI{28}{\percent} of ${}^{87}\text{Ru}$. In our \mot{} we use the former. Part
of its hyperfine level scheme is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:rubidium85}. To
create a quasi two level system we use the closed $F=3 \to F'=4$ transition.
Since this is not a real two level system there is a finite probability for the
transition from $F'=4$ to $F=2$. In this state the atom cannot be excited by
the cooling laser again. Therefore it is called \emph{dark state}. To solve
this problem a second laser, the \emph{pumping laser}, excites the atoms in the
dark state to the $F'=3$ state, from where it can decay into the cooling ground
state $F=3$ again and with this get the atom back in the cooling cycle.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{rubidium85}
    \caption{%
        Part of the ${}^{85}\text{Ru}$ level scheme. The colored transitions
        are the ones used in this experiment. The cooling beam uses the red
        transition while the blue transition is needed for the repumping.
    }

\end{figure}

\section{Diode lasers}

A diode laser is a semiconductor diode, which works quite similar to a
\textsc{led}. Photons are produced in a highly doped p-n-junction by
recombination of electrons and holes. Due to partial reflection at the border
between diode material and the surrounding air the diode becomes a resonator,
which works as laser if more atoms are excited rather than in their ground
state. This can be reached by electrical pumping with a current in forward
direction of the diode. The frequency of the laser depends on the size of the
band gap.  Because of the large active region this so called \emph{homojunction
laser diode} is very ineffective as it needs a high current density.

For our case the better diode is a so called \emph{double-heterojunction laser
diode}, which consists of a thin layer of low band gap material, sandwiched
between two high band gap layers. This type requires a lower current
density, which allows continuous wave operation at room temperature. 

The frequency range of laser diodes is typically quite large. To get a narrow
line width and to stabilize the frequency one uses an external resonator. For
this the (divergent) laser beam gets focused on a diffraction grating. For all
wavelengths the reflected beam of 0-th order points in the same direction, but
the angle of all other orders are frequency dependent. One chooses the position
of the grating so that the $-1$-st order of the wanted frequency is coupled
back into the laser, which causes a strong amplification of that frequency. 

In this experiment the position of the grating can be controlled with a Piezo
element. This allows us to choose the frequency by the voltage on the Piezo.
One can now scan trough frequencies by applying a triangular voltage.

The diode laser setup is still sensitive to mechanical distortions. For a
further frequency stabilization an error signal is fed back to the Piezo. More
about this error signal in the next sections.

\section{Doppler-free spectroscopy}

Since the Doppler broadening of spectral lines at room temperature is orders of
magnitude bigger than the natural line width, lines which lie close together
cannot be resolved. To nevertheless investigate those lines one has to use
Doppler-free spectroscopy.

For this two counterpropagating laser beams of the same frequency are needed, a
\emph{pump beam} and a \emph{probe beam} with lower intensity. The absorption
of the probe beam gets recorded. For a simple understanding again consider a
two level system with ground state $\ket{\mathrm g}$, excited state
$\ket{\mathrm e}$ and energy difference of $\hbar\omega_0$. If the lasers both
have the frequency $\omega_0$ atoms with $v\neq0$ along the laser's direction
will be out of resonance due to the Doppler effect. Those atoms with $v\approx
0$ will be excited by the pump beam and hence the absorption of the probe beam
is very low. If the lasers are detuned to the red from the resonance frequency
the pump beam and the probe beam excite oncoming atoms with respect to their
own propagation direction. Therefor the absorption of the probe beam is high.
The same holds for blue detuned lasers. This leads to a transmission spectrum
as in Figure~\ref{fig:doppler-free-2-level}. If one takes an absorption
spectrum one gets dips instead of peaks, which are called \emph{Lamb dips}.

In reality there will be more levels, which makes the absorption spectrum more
complex. Take for example a system with one ground level and two excited level
with excitation energy $\hbar\omega_1$ and $\hbar\omega_2$ respectively. When
we apply the same method as above it can happen that the pump beam is on
resonance with one of the excited levels and the probe beam with the other.
This leads to a so called \emph{cross over peak} at $\omega_\text{probe} =
(\omega_1+\omega_2)/2$ (see Figure~\ref{fig:doppler-free-3-level}).

\end{figure}

\section{Polarization spectroscopy}

The error signal for frequency stabilization can be obtained using polarization
spectroscopy. As the name implies this kind of spectroscopy uses the probe
beam's polarization rather than its intensity. The reason for this is that one
can detect small changes in polarization much better than small changes in
intensity.

Polarization spectroscopy uses a setup similar to the one of the Doppler free
saturation spectroscopy. In contrast to the latter the pump beam is circular
polarized. Additionally there are two linear polarizers, one at each
end of the spectroscopy cell, which are crossed, so that the background
signal is suppressed.

Due to the circular polarized pumping beam ($\Deltaup m = \pm1$) the degenerate
$m$ states of the transition's excited level get unequally occupied, which
leads to an alignment different from the thermal equilibrium. The resulting
anisotropy shifts the polarization axis of the linear probe beam, which hence
can be detected. The precision is due to the crossed polarizers up to three
orders of magnitude better than the precision of the saturation spectroscopy.
If there is a small angle between the two beams and if the birefringence of the
cell's windows is reduced one can obtain a signal with a dispersive profile
which allows to detect small deviations of the wanted frequency. These can be
used to correct the grating's angle so that the frequency lock remains stable.

\section{Apparatus}

Our setup consists of two blocks: the laser setup and the \mot\ setup. In the
laser setup (see Figure~\ref{fig:setup-laser}) we have two tunable lasers as
described in the chapter about theory. One will serve as a pumping laser, the
other one will be the cooling one. Both lasers are optically isolated using a
Faraday isolator. This relieves us from making sure that no light feeds back
into the laser system. Without the isolator, we would create a second laser
cavity which we do not want.

\end{figure}

Each laser has an independent locking mechanism via polarization spectroscopy.
Part of the laser beam is taken away with a polarizing beam splitter and
analysed in a rubidium cell. The error signal from each laser is fed into a
lock box (not shown) to lock the laser into the desired frequency.

The light of the two lasers is combined into an optical fiber which leads the
light to the \mot\ setup shown in Figure~\ref{fig:setup-mot}. There we split
the light into three approximately equally powered beams using $\lambda/2$
plates and polarizing beam splitters. Each of the those three linearly
polarized beams is sent through a $\lambda/4$ plate to become circularly
polarized. That is then led through the \mot\ chamber and back again with
reversed polarization.

An annotated photo of the \mot\ setup is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:setup_photo_annotated}. The colors of the beams are just to
help the eye, the beam itself always had the same IR \enquote{color}. The
individual elements are the following.

\end{enumerate}

All the nine mirrors and three $\lambda/2$ have to be adjusted by us. The
six $\lambda/4$ plates are set to a decent setting from the start.

\section{Setup and calibration}

First we have to lock the cooling laser to the right transition. For this we
tune the laser roughly to the wanted frequency. The lock box gets a triangular
signal from a function generator, changes its amplitude and offset and gives it
to the piezo which controls the grating's position. On the oscilloscope we
display the signal from the polarization spectroscopy cell and see the
spectrum. That Doppler-free spectrum of the $F=3$ ground state of
${}^{85}\text{Ru}$ is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:doppler-free-cooling}. From
there we choose the right line, zoom in (reduce scanning amplitude) and lock
the laser to a frequency a bit below the chosen transition. 

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{doppler-free-cooling}
    \caption{%
        Doppler-free spectrum of the ${}^{85}\text{Ru}$ $F=3 \to F'=2,3,4$
        lines. The time is related to the lasing frequency via the triangular
        voltage applied to the piezo.
    }
    \label{fig:doppler-free-cooling}
\end{figure}

For the pumping laser we repeat the last steps. The Doppler-free spectrum of the
$F=2$ ground state of ${}^{85}\text{Ru}$ is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:doppler-free-pumping}. The lines are so close together that we
can not distinguish between them. Instead of trying to lock we quasi-lock by
zooming in far to the spot where we expect the right transition to be.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{doppler-free-pumping}
    \caption{%
        Doppler-free spectrum of the ${}^{85}\text{Ru}$ $F=2 \to F'=1,2,3$
        lines. The time is related to the lasing frequency via the triangular
        voltage applied to the piezo. Since one can not distinguish between
        lines, the labels are only rough estimates. 
    }
    \label{fig:doppler-free-pumping}
\end{figure}

Now we check if enough light is passing through the fiber. With the
powermeter we measure a total power of \SI{16.8}{\milli\watt}. Then be block
the path of the pumping laser and measure again. Now we get
\SI{14.1}{\milli\watt}. The instruction states the cooling laser needs to be at
least \SI{5}{\milli\watt} and the pumping laser \SI{1}{\milli\watt}, which both
is clearly the case for our setup.

After that we have to adjust the polarizing beam splitter and the mirrors. For
that we first check if the first \textsc{pbs} and the bottom elevator mirrors
are hit nicely by the beam. After this is the case we modify the bottom
$z$-mirror's orientation such that the beam passes through the center of the
vacuum chamber. Then we adjust the top mirror such that the beams overlap
perfectly. This can be checked with the help of a camera, which is still
sensitive to the beam's wavelength.

Before we adjust the transversal ($x$ and $y$) beams we try to get equal light
power to each axis. So we measure the fiber power again, which is
\SI{15.1}{\milli\watt} and set the $z$-axis power to to \SI{5.0}{\milli\watt}
by rotating the $\lambda/2$ plate behind the fiber. Against our expectations we
then have no power on the transversal elevator. We try it the other way around
and adjust the $\lambda/2$ plate again until we have \SI{8.8}{\milli\watt} on
the elevator and \SI{4.8}{\milli\watt} on the $z$-axis.

After measuring the beam power directly in front of the vacuum chamber we
realize that we incur loss on all the mirrors and first adjust the splitting in
the transversal directions to be symmetric. There now are \SI{2.7}{\milli\watt}
on each of them. Then we adjust the initial $\lambda/2$ plate to give more
power to the transversal and less to the longitudinal direction. After that we
have \SI{3.1}{\milli\watt} behind each polarizing beam splitter.

We start to adjust the transversal mirrors. We calibrate the $y$ direction
first. When the reflected beam coincides nicely with the incident beam we move
on to the $x$ direction and repeat the procedure. 

After checking the locking of the lasers again we tweak all the mirrors to
optimize the overlap. Now when toggling the power supply of the magnetic field,
we can see a little difference in the brightness which indicates a working
\mot. With the help of a photo diode we then adjust the laser locks to make the
\mot{} even larger. We use every degree of freedom from the mirrors and
slightly tune it to optimize the \mot\ signal. We repeat this twice for every
little screw such that we should be very close at the maximum in the parameter
space.

\begin{table}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{SSS}
        \toprule
        {total power/\si{\nano\watt}}
        & {background/\si{\nano\watt}}

        Measured powers. The third column is just the difference of the first
        two columns.
    }
    \label{tab:mot_power}
\end{table}

\section{MOT characterization}

Now that the \mot\ is there, we want to characterize it. We are interested in
the number of atoms caught, the volume and scattering cross section of the
rubidium. One needs a few quantities in order to obtain the derived quantities.

\subsection{Lens configuration}

We need the diameter of the lens and its distance to the \mot. Since the
lens is an 1 inch lens, its radius is $d/2 = \SI{<< lens_radius_cm
>>}{\centi\meter}$. Its distance to the \mot\ is $l = \SI{<< lens_distance_cm
>>}{\centi\meter}$, roughly estimated. Then we can work out the solid angle
that is taken up by the lens. The solid angle is $4 \piup$ for the whole
sphere. Therefore we need to take the ratio of the lens surface ($\piup d^2/4$)
and divide it by the total surface of a sphere at distance $l$, $4 \piup l^2$.
In total we will then obtain
\[
    \Omega = 4 \piup \frac{\piup d^2}{16 \piup l^2} = \frac{\piup d^2}{4 l^2}
    = \SI{<< mot_omega >>}{\steradian} \,.
\]

\subsection{Fluorescence power}

We then have to find the fluorescence power of the \mot. After replacing the
photo diode with the powermeter, we see that our \mot{} is very bright but
not very constant in power. Therefore we measure a few times to find a mean
value (see Table~\ref{tab:mot_power}). Our \mot's power is hence $p = \SI{<<
power_mot >>}{\nano\watt}$ which is quite good, as the instruction states that
about \SI{50}{\nano\watt} are needed.

With the solid angle we can convert the measured power $p$ into the actual
emitted power of the whole \mot, $p_\text{tot}$. We do this by dividing through
the solid angle:
\[
    p_\text{tot} = p \frac{4 \piup}{\Omega}
    = \SI{<< mot_power_tot_nW >>}{\nano\watt} \,.
\]

\subsection{Beam intensity}

Then we need the beam's power. We measure on each axis separately and get $P_x
= \SI{3.57}{\milli\watt}$, $P_y = \SI{3.36}{\milli\watt}$ and $P_z =
\SI{4.45}{\milli\watt}$.

Another quantity we have to know is the beam diameter. For this we put a razor
blade on an optical rail in the $y$-beam and measure the remaining power
depending on the razor's position. Our measurements are shown in
Table~\ref{tab:beam_diameter}.

\begin{table}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{SS}
        \toprule
        {absolute position/\si{\centi\meter}}
        & {power of beam/\si{\milli\watt}} \\
        \midrule
        %< for row in beam_diameter_table >%
        << ' & '.join(row) >> \\
        %< endfor >%
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{%
        Measurement to estimate the beam diameter.
    }
    \label{tab:beam_diameter}
\end{table}

The collected data is also shown in Figure~\ref{fig:diameter} with a Gaussian
\textsc{cdf}\footnote{cumulative density function} fit. From the fit we derive
a beam power of \SI{<< beam_power >>}{\milli\watt} for the $y$-branch and an
$\eup^{-2}$ beam diameter of \SI{<< beam_diameter >>}{\centi\meter}. Errors are
estimated by the diagonal of the fit covariance matrix.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{diameter}
    \caption{%
        Beam diameter measurement. Shown is the beam power that is left after
        moving the razor blade to the given position.
    }
    \label{fig:diameter}
\end{figure}

The beam intensity $I$ is the total energy of the six beams (\SI{<<
total_beam_power_mW >>}{\milli\watt}) divided by the cross sectional area of
the beam, $\pi r^2 = \SI{<< beam_area_cm >>}{\centi\meter\squared}$. We have
\[
    I = 2 \frac{P_x + P_y + P_z}{\pi r^2}
    = \SI{<< intens_mW_cm2 >>}{\milli\watt\per\centi\meter\squared}
    \,,
\]
where the factor two stems from the backreflection of each beam back through
the chamber. With the intensity $I$ we can build up give the scattering rate of
an individual atom as given by \textcite[Equation~(4)]{wieman/inexpensive}
and already used in our theory chapter:
\[
    R = \frac{(I/I_\mathrm s) \piup \Gamma}{1 + (I/I_\mathrm s) + 4
    (\Delta/\Gamma)^2}
    = \SI{<< scattering_rate_MHz >>}{\mega\hertz}
    \,.
\]
The authors state the natural line width $\Gamma = \SI{6}{\mega\hertz}$ and
$I_\mathrm s = \SI{4.1}{\milli\watt\per\centi\meter\squared}$
\textcite[328]{wieman/inexpensive}.
We also need the wavelength $\lambda = \SI{<< wavelength_nm >>}{\nano\meter}$.
Using that we can compute $\hbar\omega = \SI{<< hbar_omega_nW_MHz
>>}{\nano\watt\per\mega\hertz}$. The funny unit will become handy later on.

\subsection{Detuning of the laser frequencies}

So far we have tweaked the detuning of the cooling and repumping lasers in
order to get the largest \mot. Now we want to investigate the \mot\ dependence
on the detuning. First we unlock the cooling laser. Then we use the frequency
generate to generate a \SI{100}{\milli\hertz} triangular signal which we use
as detuning of the cooling laser.

Using the photodiode, we can get fast feedback from the \mot. We attach the
cooling laser rubidium spectrum signal and the photodiode to the oscilloscope.
Then we set the trigger on the rising flank of the \mot\ signal. One spectrum
with the magnetic field switched on is taken, another one without the field.
This way we can subtract the background. The difference between the two \mot\
signals gives the intensity of the \mot\ itself. We plot that signal together
this the rubidium spectrum, that is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:scan-cooling}.

% TODO What was this number for?
% \SI{3.9}{\milli\watt}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{scan-cooling}
    \caption{%
        Scanning of the cooling laser. The rubidium spectrum of the cooling
        laser is shown in black. The red curve is the difference of photodiode
        signals with and without the magnetic field. One can see that the \mot\
        forms only at the cooling transition. The thick orange lines are
        Gaussian fits to the peaks.
    }
    \label{fig:scan-cooling}
\end{figure}

The time scale in that diagram is given by the scanning frequency chosen via
the function generator. It is not really meaningful for our experiment.
Therefore we identify three peaks in the rubidium spectrum. We fit a Gaussian
curve to obtain the center of each peak. Then using the level shifts given in
the second oscillogram from the appendix of the manual, we can obtain a
connection between the scanning time and the detuning from the cooling
transition. The three values used are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:scan-cooling-spacing}. We perform a linear fit and use this to
convert the time scale into a frequency scale.
Figure~\ref{fig:scan-cooling-detuning} shows the dependence of the \mot\
response (background already subtracted) with respect to the detuning
frequency.

\begin{figure}
    \centering

    \end{subfigure}
    \hfill

            }
        \label{fig:scan-cooling-detuning}
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{%
        }
    \label{fig:}
\end{figure}

Performing a Gaussian fit to the \mot\ response peak, we can get a good
estimate of the central value of that peak. This should be the detuning that we
have used then we optimized the \mot\ for brightness in the previous steps. The
Gaussian fit gives us a central value of $\Delta = \SI{<< detuning
>>}{\mega\hertz}$.

This was the dependence on the cooling laser frequency. The whole time, we have
kept the pumping laser locked. Now we will exchange the roles and lock the
cooling laser. Then we unlock the pumping laser and let it scan with the same
slow frequency from the generator. In Figure~\ref{fig:scan-pumping} we show the
rubidium spectrum and the \mot\ signal without background.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{scan-pumping}
    \caption{%
        Scanning of the pumping laser. The rubidium spectrum of the pumping
        laser is shown in black. The red curve is the difference of photodiode
        signals with and without the magnetic field, i.e.\ the \mot\ signal.
    }
    \label{fig:scan-pumping}
\end{figure}

We would like to have done the same conversion of scanning time to detuning
frequency. However, the peaks are too smeared out to perform a decent Gaussian
fit. Therefore we cannot convert this into a detuning frequency.
In the figure one can see that the greatest response in the \mot\ happens at
the point where one would expect to see the repumping transition, that is
between \SIrange{0.6}{1.0}{\second} on this scale.

\subsection{Number of atoms}

Now we have everything we need to compute the number of atoms in the \mot. The
number of quantities going into this number is rather high, therefore see
Figure~\ref{fig:mot-population-flow} for a \enquote{flowchart} of the
quantities used.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{mot-population-flow}
    \caption{%
        Conversion of quantities to obtain the \mot\ population.
    }
    \label{fig:mot-population-flow}
\end{figure}

With a wavelength of the cooling laser $\lambda$ we can compute the angular
frequency $\omega$ and the photon energy $\hbar\omega$. Dividing the total
power by the energy of a single photon gives us the total scattering rate
\[
    NR = \frac{4 \piup p}{\Omega \hbar \omega} \,.
\]
Dividing by the scattering rate we arrive at the expression for the atom number
depending only on observables that we have:
\[
    N = \frac{4 \piup p}{\Omega \hbar \omega} 
    \frac{1 + (I/I_\mathrm s) + 4 (\Delta/\Gamma)^2}{(I/I_\mathrm s) \piup \Gamma}
    = \num{<< atom_number >>}
    \,.
\]

\subsection{Size of MOT}

Now we want an estimate of our \mot's spatial size. For this we first take a
picture of the chamber with the \mot\ and without it. Then we subtract those
images in order to remove the background from the other laser beams. The
subtracted image is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:difference-3-inv}.

Then we turn the camera and take a picture of a scale at the same distance. The
image of the centimeter scale is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:scale}. For a rough
estimation, the superposition of the \mot\ signal and the scale shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:motsize} can used. The radius of the \mot\ should be in the
neighborhood of say \SI{2}{\milli\meter}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.7\linewidth]{difference-3-inv.png}
    \caption{Substraction image showing the \mot.}
    \label{fig:difference-3-inv}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
    \begin{subfigure}{.45\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{scale.png}
        \caption{Whole image of scale.}
        \label{fig:scale}
    \end{subfigure}
    \hfill
    \begin{subfigure}{.45\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{motsize}
        \caption{Superposition of \mot\ and scale.}
        \label{fig:motsize}
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Millimeter scale at the same distance as the \mot.}
    \label{fig:mot_size}
\end{figure}

We want to have a more exact estimation of this area. We therefore let the
computer sum the pixel values of a cropped version shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:mot-crop}. Then we divide by the difference in maximum and
minimum value. This should give an good estimation of the \mot\ size. Our
algorithm counts \num{<< mot_white_pixels >>} white pixels belonging to the
\mot. Some dark gray pixels contribute a bit, some light gray pixels do not
contribute fully. We hope that on average this works out. For comparison, the
image used has \num{<< mot_total_pixels >>} pixels.

We carefully choose two points on the millimeter scale which are
\SI{10}{\milli\meter} apart and near the spot where the \mot\ is on our images.
This reduces the statistical error a bit while not becoming too sensitive to
lens distortions. We conclude that in the focal plane of the camera, we can
convert with the constant \SI{<< mot_mm_per_pixel >>}{\milli\meter\per\pixel}
to physical sizes.\footnote{\si{\pixel} is the unit for pixels, at least in CSS
(Cascading Style Sheets).} From the number of white pixels, \num{<<
mot_white_pixels >>}, we conclude that we have a radius of \SI{<< mot_radius_px
>>}{\pixel} and thus \SI{<< mot_radius_mm >>}{\milli\meter} assuming that a
circle is a good approximation. Judging by Figure~\ref{fig:motsize}, this is a
sensible result. Converting this radius to a volume, we obtain a spherical
\mot\ volume of \SI{<< mot_volume_mm3 >>}{\milli\meter\cubed}.

    \includegraphics[width=.3\linewidth]{mot-crop}
    \caption{%

    }
    \label{fig:mot-crop}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Influence of quarter waveplates}

The effect of the $\lambda/4$ plates in front of the \mot{} is significant.
This is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:lambda_front}. Depending on the orientation of
the plates the beam behind the plate stays linearly or becomes elliptically or
circularly polarized. This can suppress the formation of the trap completely.
We have fitted a $\cos(\phi - \phi_0)^2$ function to the data as we expect the
amplitude to scale with the cosine and the intensity with the square of that.

The effect of the plates in the backreflected beam can be seen in
Figure~\ref{fig:lambda_behind}. It is not very large. Ideally there should be
no change of the \mot's power, of course. The effect that we do see indicates
that the light going through the \mot\ is not perfectly circularly polarized.

    }
    \label{fig:}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Influence of magnetic field}

With the power meter still attached, we can investigate the influence of the
external magnetic field onto the \mot\ power. We just vary the current that
goes through the magnetic coils. In steps of around \SI{0.5}{\ampere} we take
measurements. We first started with the maximum current and then go to no
current. After that we measured a few more points in the middle. While doing
this we noticed deviations from the previous measurements. This could be some
mild hysteresis effect. In principle the copper coils should not have a strong
ferromagnetism and therefore should not inhibit a significant hysteresis. We
also observed large fluctuations of around \SI{40}{\nano\watt} while taking the
measurement. Therefore this could also be just statistical jitter that we have
observed.

% TODO Table with magnetic field.

The dependence of the \mot\ intensity on the external magnetic field current is
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:magnetic}. One can see some sigmoidal shape here.
Given the large errors of our measurement, one could perhaps also succeed with
a linear fit. Nevertheless, a sigmoidal shape does make sense: For vanishing
magnetic field, we do not expect to see a \mot\ signal, only some background
from the optical molasses trapped for a very short time. Reversing the magnetic
field should not make the signal go below \SI{320}{\nano\watt}.
Unfortunately, we did not test that.

A small magnetic field would give a small force and we would expect to see a
smooth onset of some rising curve. At some magnetic field density, we have a
deep potential to catch the atoms in. We will become limited by other
parameters of the setup, for instance the beam overlap. Therefore the growing
trend will have to stop for some magnetic field. It is expected to see two flat
regimes connected by some smooth function. That will just be a sigmoidal shape.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{magnetic}
    \caption{%
        \mot\ response to a changing magnetic field. The points in the middle
        have been measured twice after we noticed some hysteresis effect.
    }
    \label{fig:magnetic}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Loading behavior}

To model the loading of the trap, we use a rising exponential with steady-state
load $N_0$, start time $t_0$ and the \enquote{lifetime} in the filling process
as given by \textcite[Equation~(1)]{wieman/inexpensive}:
\[
    N(t) = N_0 \sbr{1 - \exp\del{- \frac{t - t_0}{\tau}}} \,.
\]

Figure~\ref{fig:loading} shows four of six measurements that we did for the
loading of the \mot. We have rescaled and shifted all signals from the
photodiode such that one can easily compare the signals visually.

\begin{figure}
    \centering

    \hfill

        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{loading-4}
        \caption{%
            %
            }
        \label{fig:/2}
    \end{subfigure}

    \caption{%
        Repeated measurement of the \mot\ loading time. The signal of the
        photodiode is voltage measured at the oscilloscope. We have rescaled
        the signal such that no \mot\ is around zero and with \mot it is around
        unity. We have also shifted it such that $t_0 = 0$ for better
        comparison. In red the rising exponential fit is shown.
        }
    \label{fig:loading}
\end{figure}

Fitting the function to our data from the rise of the signal, we obtain an
average loading time of $\tau = \SI{<< loading_lifetime >>}{\second}$. Judging
from the plots, this is a reasonable result.

\subsection{Rubidium cross section}

The pressure inside could not be measured during the experiment as the device
was broken. Therefore we were given the pressure to lie in the range
\SIrange{1.1e-7}{1.5e-7}{\milli\bar}. Therefore we will use $P = \SI{<<
pressure >>}{\pascal}$ for our calculations. The error is just the standard
deviation of both points. The room temperature has been \SI{24}{\celsius}.

The time constant~$\tau$ is the inverse of the scattering rate.
In our case we can ignore the background atoms and assume that the scattering
only happens with the rubidium atoms. Therefore Equation~(2) in the paper of
\textcite{wieman/inexpensive} reduces to
\[
    \tau\inv = n \sigma v \,.
\]
We want to compute the cross section. Therefore we need the number density $n$
and the velocity $v$. The average velocity of the thermal distribution will
suit our needs here. It is given by
\[
    v = \sqrt{\frac{2 k_\mathrm B T}{m}}
    = \SI{<< velocity >>}{\meter\per\second} \,,
\]
where $m = \SI{<< rubidium_mass >>}{\kilogram}$ is the mass of rubidium atoms
\parencite[320]{wieman/inexpensive}. The density $n$ can be computed using
\[
    n = \frac{P}{k_\mathrm B T}
    = \SI{<< density >>}{\per\meter\cubed} \,.
\]
Solving the above equation for the cross section $\sigma$, we obtain
\[
    \sigma = \frac{1}{\tau n v}
    = \SI{<< cross_section >>}{\meter\squared} \,.
\]

\chapter{Conclusion}

In this experiment we built up a \mot\ by adjusting the mirrors and
$\lambda/2$ plates on the given setup. We were able to achieve a \mot\ power
of around \SI{<< power_mot >>}{\nano\watt} with our configuration. This is much
higher than needed, which is good.

Then by measuring the cooling laser beam intensity and diameter we were able to
compute the beam intensity and the cooling scattering rate. By measuring the
detuning of the cooling laser we were able to estimate the number of atoms in
our \mot\ to be \num{<< atom_number >>}.

The volume of our \mot\ is \SI{<< mot_volume_mm3 >>}{\milli\meter\cubed},
determined from a photo taken with a camera.

The loading behavior has a time constant of $\tau = \SI{<< loading_lifetime
>>}{\second}$. From that we were able to compute the cross section of
scattering with background rubidium gas go be \SI{<< cross_section
>>}{\meter\squared}. This is a sensible result as the diameter of the hydrogen
atom is around \SI{e-10}{\meter}. Rubidium will be somewhat larger. Taking the
square of this diameter will give a ballpark estimation of the cross section as
we assume short-range scattering.

The large errors on our measurements mostly stem on from the uncertainty of the
distance between the \mot\ and the lens which projects the \mot\ onto the power
meter. Also the pressure was not known precisely. All in all we only get one
significant digit for most derived quantities. If there would be a way to get a
better position measurement of the lens, all errors could be reduced
significantly.

It was nice to have an oscilloscope which would write the raw data to the USB
thumbdrive. That way we could extract the loading time from the raw
measurements and did not have to twiddle with an exported image of the
oscillogram.
